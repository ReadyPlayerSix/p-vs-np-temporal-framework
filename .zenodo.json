    "title": "P vs NP: Redefining Complexity Classes Beyond Mathematical Constructs",
    "description": "This work presents a novel framework to reenvision the P vs NP problem through the synthesis of computational phase transitions, knowledge accumulation dynamics, and thermodynamic principles. By formalizing problem-solving capability as a thermodynamic process, we establish physical failure points as natural delimiters that demonstrate how the gap between P and NP emerges from the inherent constraints of physical systems rather than purely mathematical constructs.",

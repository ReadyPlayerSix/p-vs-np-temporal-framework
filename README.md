# P vs NP: A Temporal Knowledge Framework

## Overview

This repository contains a novel theoretical framework examining the P vs NP problem through the lens of temporal knowledge accumulation and physical constraints. The work introduces a mathematical model that bridges computational complexity theory with fundamental physical limits and collective knowledge dynamics.

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel framework for reenvisioning the P vs NP problem through the synthesis of computational phase transitions, knowledge accumulation dynamics, and thermodynamic principles. By formalizing problem-solving capability as a thermodynamic process, we introduce a temporal knowledge function K(t) that quantifies how computational systems evolve under fundamental physical and logical constraints. Our analysis reveals that the gap between solution and verification times persists due to intrinsic barriers rooted in the nature of computation itself—barriers that remain invariant across classical, quantum, and hypothetical computational paradigms.

# P vs NP Analysis: A Knowledge-Based Mathematical Framework

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14749668.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14749668)

## Overview

This repository presents a novel framework for reenvisioning the P vs NP problem through the synthesis of computational phase transitions, knowledge accumulation dynamics, and thermodynamic principles. By formalizing problem-solving capability as a thermodynamic process, we introduce a temporal knowledge function K(t) that quantifies how computational systems evolve under fundamental physical and logical constraints.

## Key Contributions

-   Novel temporal knowledge framework for analyzing P vs NP
-   Mathematical formalization of knowledge accumulation barriers
-   Integration of physical constraints with computational complexity
-   Empirical validation across multiple scale regimes

## Project Structure

-   `/paper` - LaTeX manuscript with complete mathematical proofs and analysis
-   `/docs` - Supporting documentation and implementation strategies
-   `/src` - Interactive demonstrations and visualizations (coming soon)

## Interactive Demonstrations

This repository will include interactive visualizations demonstrating:

-   Phase transition visualizations
-   Knowledge accumulation model simulator
-   Parallel processing penalty demonstrations
-   Efficiency curves across energy regimes

_Interactive components are under development. Watch this space for updates!_

## Getting Started

(Development environment setup and usage instructions will be added as interactive components are implemented)

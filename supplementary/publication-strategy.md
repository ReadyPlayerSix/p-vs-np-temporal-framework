# Publication and Interactive Demonstration Strategy

## Primary Publication Plan
1. **Zenodo Publication**
   - Provides DOI and immutable timestamps
   - CERN backing for credibility
   - Accepts independent researchers
   - GitHub integration capabilities
   - Current paper written in Overleaf will need to be exported as PDF for submission

## Interactive Demonstration Development
1. **GitHub Repository Structure**
   - Main paper content and updates
   - Interactive models and demonstrations
   - Visualization components
   - Integration with Zenodo for version control

2. **React Components to Develop**
   - Phase transition visualizations
   - Knowledge accumulation model simulator
   - Parallel processing penalty demonstrations
   - Efficiency curves across energy regimes
   - Interactive graphs from paper figures

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Frontend: React with TypeScript
   - Visualization libraries: Recharts/D3.js
   - Mathematical computations: Math.js
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS

4. **Portfolio Integration**
   - Showcase theoretical understanding
   - Demonstrate practical implementation skills
   - Example of complex scientific web application
   - Evidence of mathematical/algorithmic capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Export current Overleaf paper as PDF
2. Set up Zenodo submission
3. Create GitHub repository structure
4. Begin developing interactive components
5. Link Zenodo and GitHub repositories
6. Document installation and usage instructions

## Future Considerations
1. Potential arXiv submission when possible
2. Updates and version control through Zenodo
3. Expanding interactive demonstrations based on feedback
4. Integration with other platforms (ResearchGate, etc.)

## Notes
- Keep versions synchronized between Overleaf, Zenodo, and GitHub
- Maintain clear documentation for all interactive components
- Consider accessibility in web implementations
- Track citations and references across platforms
